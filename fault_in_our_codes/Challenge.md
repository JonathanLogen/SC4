## Fault In Our Codes
- Another mindless game... see how many times you can press my button! If you get more than 2^30th power presses, than I'll give you a flag!
- Hint: What's weird about pressing Cntrl+C?
- Hint: Can you interrupt in the middle of a program? Could you get a higher score from causing faults at unexpected times?
