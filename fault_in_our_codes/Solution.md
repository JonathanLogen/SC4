## Solution 
- There is a signal handler for SIGINT, otherwise known as Cntrl+C
	- When Cntrl+C is pressed on the first time, the program will go to the code at ``sig_handler`` no matter WHAT is going on. 
	- After this, it will recursively call the 'start' function again. 
- Why does this matter? The code will STOP in its tracks no matter where we are at in the code! 
	- The save function 'clears' the save file by setting it to all 1s. 
	- If we interrupt the code after the clear but before the save, the saved slot will be all 1s!
- If we check the score after performing this, the score will be higher than the high score, giving us the flag. 
- Inputs: 
	- 0 - choose slot 0
	- 2 - save the game
	- Cntrl + C - done AFTER the text 'Clearing previous game' but BEFORE 'Saving game' appears. 
	- Enter
	- 0 - Choose same slot as before
	- 3 - Check high score
