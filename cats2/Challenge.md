# cats2
- The web application written in PHP that simply displays cats! The user can also upload their own images. This time, you can ONLY store text files to talk about cats - md and txt. No more hacking!
- Hint: Flag is in the root directory at ``/flag.txt``
- Hint: How are the files being pulled from the server to be displayed?
