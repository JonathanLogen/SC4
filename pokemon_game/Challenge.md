# Pokete Games
- Many mobile games are easily hackable by changing the configuration files. So, I wanted to show that off in this challenge. 
- The final challenge is a bonus one that I stumbled upon while testing it out myself. Decided to keep it in here as a special bonus challenge with rewards at the end.
- Original source code from: https://github.com/lxgr-linux/pokete - super rad game!

## Pokete Games - Level 1
- Pokete - gotta catch them b'all! Have you ever wondered how saving a game works? Most of the time, espicailly with mobile games, it is simply a file that contains the current state. Things like the X,Y coordinate, the map, items collected and etc. are all going to be in this. 
- For the first challenge, find out the storage location of the file. Please ONLY provide the file name for this. 
- Hint: Look at the source code in ``pokete.py`` and environment variables

## Pokete Games - Infinite Money 
- Getting money takes too much time... see if you can get infinite money in the game. To claim the flag, get more than '100000000' poke dollars. 
- Hint: What's an easy way to do this? 

## Pokete Games - Cheating with Shinies
- Getting shiny pokete's takes too much time... give yourself a shiny Pikachu.
- Hint: What's an easy way to do this? 

## Pokete Games - Teleportation
- Getting from town to town takes too much time ... teleport to the 'Arena of Agrawos'. 
- Hint: What's an easy way to do this? 
- Hint: Look at the ``maps.py`` file 

## Pokete Games - Unintended Solution 
- The original developer of Pokete did not anticipiate this running in a potentially malicious environment. It's possible to get code execution inside this process through the configuration file loading process. Can you find the trick? First person to complete this gets a prize for the unintended solution. 
- Hint: Too hard - no hints :)
