# cats3
- The web application written in PHP that simply displays cats! The user can also upload their own images. Now, the file is referenced from the ``/var/www/html/text/`` directly! No more hacking!
- Hint: Flag is in the root directory at ``/flag.txt``
- Hint: How are the files being pulled from the server to be displayed?
