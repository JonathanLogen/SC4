# Crypto - (Secretly) Learning RSA
**Author** Marnold@securityinnovation.com

3 sequential challenges that hopefully teach some basic RSA concepts

* **Loops 1** (intro_mod.py) - Introduces modular arithmetic and multiplicative inverses

* **Loops 2** (babyrsa.py) - Introduces exponentiation over a finite field

* **Loops 3** (kidrsa.py) - Teaches the concept of encryption and decryption keys

## Building

Run

```
./docker_run.sh
```

The challenge will be served as SSH users loops1, loops2, and loops3 on port 2227.
