# Loops
Some cryptography challenges using math that makes nice loops!

The challenge is split into three parts,
- loops1 introduces modular arithmetic
- loops2 shows how exponentiation and modulus combine to make nice loops
- loops3 uses those loops and a bit of fancy math to hide secrets

Brute-force algorithms are a great place to start, especially when looking
for patterns, but they won't be fast enough for the final step.

Some of this math can be a bit confusing, here are some helpful tips:
- The extended euclidean algorithm might be helpful for loops1
- Remember that you only need to find a loop, not the smallest loop, for loops2
- Think about exponent rules for loops3, does anything look familiar?
