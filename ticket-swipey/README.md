# Be Swift!

![music*band](musicband.png)

How do you do, fellow kids? I, like many hip youngins LOVE music!
That is why I am excited to announce the Music‚≠êBand World Tour in 2023!

The hype is palpable! The anticipation is appreciable! The razzmatazz is detectable!

This show is gon' be LITTY.

It's gon' be FIRE!

FIRE!

The ticket site is on FIRE!!!

## Wat?

Inspired by a ticket vendor debacle involving a decorated pop music artist, who had _swiftly_ taken over the
top 10 charts, this challenge simulates the experience of snapping up coveted presale tickets before anybody else.

Are you gonna scalp them tickets after?

It ain't my business what you do with em.

## Setup

Change ports on `Dockerfile` and `docker_run.sh` if needed. I'm using port `8199`.

```
cd ticket-swipey
./docker_run.sh
```
