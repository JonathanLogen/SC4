## Challenge 1
Firsty: Can you overflow my buffer? Overwrite the variable 'x' to get the flag. 


## Challenge 2
Dead: I donâ€™t want to fix my buffer! Try to overwrite my buffer with the value 0xdeadbeef.
- Hint: Endianness is the tricky part here.
- Hint: GDB is amazing for debugging. Try to use it! :) 
- Hint: Use ``python3 -c "import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b'A' * 0x1 + b'\x11\x22\x33\x44')" | ./dead``
- Hint: The offset is 0x10 bytes

## Challenge 3
Auth: Can you overwrite the control flow? The goal is to overwrite the previously stopped instruction pointer to jump to 'do_valid_stuff. 
- Hint: How does the RET instruction pointer and stack work on x86?
- Hint: Use ``python3 -c "import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b'A' * 0x1 + b'\x11\x22\x33\x44')" | ./dead``
- Hint: The offset is 0x1c bytes
