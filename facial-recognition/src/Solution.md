## Overview
- The facial recognition can be tricked with images. 

## Solution 
- The facial recognition works really well! If you put two people next to it, it can demonstrate one is not the other. 
- However, the recognition cannot tell the difference between a picture and a real person. 
- So, by taking a picture of Nathan on your phone and placing this in front of the camera. Logging in with this user (nkirkland) with the picture will bypass the authentication!
- Pretty neat!
- The iPhone prevents this type of attack by using depth mapping on the phone itself.
